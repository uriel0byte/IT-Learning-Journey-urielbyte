## Methodology

Each investigation follows the LetsDefend playbook structure but extends it where the evidence warrants. Standard workflow:

1. **Triage** — Review alert fields, classify source IP as internal or external.
2. **Threat Intelligence & IP Reputation** — Query VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, and LetsDefend TI before touching logs.
3. **Traffic Analysis** — Confirm attack scope via SIEM log management. Single host or network-wide?
4. **Endpoint Analysis** — Check Windows Event Logs (4624/4625), process list, terminal history, and browser history on the affected host via Endpoint Security.
5. **Verdict & Containment** — Isolate if compromised. Document findings, IOCs, and remediation steps.
6. **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** — Map confirmed techniques to ATT&CK sub-techniques where possible.

*Each report is written from my own investigation first.*
*The official LetsDefend report is reviewed afterward as a calibration check.*
