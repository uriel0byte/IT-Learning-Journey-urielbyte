# Day 1: Shells and Bells - Linux Command Line

## 📋 Quick Facts

## 🎯 What This Challenge Was About
This was an introduction to Linux command-line basics. The challenge put me in the role of an IT administrator who needed to navigate the file system, search for files, and manage permissions. It started easy with basic commands and gradually introduced more complex tasks like finding hidden files and understanding file permissions.

## 💡 Top 3 Things I Learned
1. **File Navigation:** I learned essential commands like cd, ls -la, pwd, and find for navigating and exploring the Linux file system. Understanding the -la flags showed me hidden files and detailed permissions.
2. **Text Processing:** Using cat, grep, and head/tail to search through files and filter content. This is exactly what SOC analysts do when parsing through log files.
3. **Permissions Understanding:** The chmod command and how Linux permissions work (read, write, execute for user, group, others). This is critical for security—misconfigured permissions are a common vulnerability.

## 🛠️ Tools I Used
- **Linux Bash Terminal:** All commands were executed in the command line
- **find command:** For locating specific files across directories
- **grep command:** For searching text patterns within files

## 🤔 Challenge I Faced
I didn't have any problems at all for all of the question provided but I struggled a while at trying to get access to (Side Quest 1 - The Great Disappearing Act) for about 1 hour and finally push through and finished it. So, I tried to do that Side Quest 1 but it was out of my league. I don't have enough knowledge to be able to finish it so I moved on.

## ✅ How This Helps My Career
Linux proficiency seems to appear in a lot of SOC analyst job postings because most security tools (SIEM, IDS/IPS, forensics tools) run on Linux servers. Being comfortable with the command line is non-negotiable. This challenge gave me hands-on practice with the exact commands I'll use daily to investigate log files, search for indicators of compromise, and analyze system configurations.
