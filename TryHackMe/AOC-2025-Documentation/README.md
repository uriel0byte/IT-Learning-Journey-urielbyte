## 📊 Learning Journey Highlights

### Why I Participated
As an ILS student transitioning to cybersecurity, I needed practical, hands-on experience to complement my Security+ theoretical studies. AOC 2025 provided structured daily challenges that built progressively from foundational to advanced concepts.

### What I Learned
- **Technical Skills:** SIEM operations (Splunk, Sentinel), malware analysis (static/dynamic), network scanning, web exploitation, container security, cloud security (Azure, AWS), ICS/OT security
- **Problem-Solving:** Systematic investigation methodologies, attack chain analysis, multi-source log correlation
- **Professional Skills:** Technical documentation, portfolio creation, time management
- **Tool Proficiency:** 50+ industry-standard tools including Splunk, Nmap, Burp Suite, Azure Sentinel, CyberChef, AWS CLI, RITA, Zeek, Registry Explorer

### Growth & Challenges
The event started with accessible Linux basics and gradually increased in complexity. Days 3 (Splunk), 10 (Azure Sentinel), 15 (Web Forensics), 19 (ICS/SCADA), and 22 (C2 Detection) were particularly challenging, requiring deeper understanding of log correlation, cloud security, industrial systems, and network-based threat hunting.

**Honest Assessment:**
- Some days (web security, programming-heavy challenges) were outside my comfort zone
- KQL and SPL query languages required significant practice and reference documentation
- Persistence and documentation proved more valuable than natural aptitude
- Enhanced documentation serves as personal reference for future SOC work

### Connection to Career Goals
Every skill learned aligns directly with SOC Analyst responsibilities: alert triage, log analysis, incident investigation, threat detection, and forensics. This practical experience complements my Security+ preparation and demonstrates to recruiters that I can apply theoretical knowledge in real scenarios.

**Focus Area:** Blue Team / Defensive Security / SOC Operations
