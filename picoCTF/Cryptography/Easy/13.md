Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}

# Hints
1.  This can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!

# What is Cipher
A cipher is a method, or algorithm, used in cryptography for performing encryption (converting readable text into unreadable text) and decryption (converting it back).

A cipher takes the original readable message, called plaintext, and a key to transform it into the unreadable form, called ciphertext.

# What is ROT13
ROT13 (short for "Rotate by 13 places") is a very simple letter substitution cipher and a specific case of the Caesar cipher.

    - Substitution: It replaces each letter in the plaintext with another letter.

    - Rotation: It replaces a letter with the letter 13 places after it in the Latin alphabet.

        - For example, 'A' becomes 'N', 'B' becomes 'O', and so on.

        - Once the shift reaches the end of the alphabet, it wraps around to the beginning (e.g., 'N' becomes 'A', 'Z' becomes 'M').

    - Self-Inverse: Applying ROT13 twice restores the original text, as 13+13=26 (the number of letters in the alphabet).

    - Purpose: It offers virtually no security and is primarily used to obscure text, such as hiding jokes, puzzle answers, or spoilers in online forums so they aren't read accidentally.

# Steps
1. Open an online tool like CyberChef.
2. Select the ROT13 Operation.
3. Copy and paste the provided cipher text.
4. Click BAKE or button to continue the process.
