# What is Letter Number Code

The **Letter Number Code (A1Z26)** is a very simple **substitution cipher** where each letter of the alphabet is directly replaced by its corresponding numerical position.

The name "A1Z26" describes the rule:
* **A** is replaced by **1**
* **B** is replaced by **2**
* ...
* **Z** is replaced by **26**

For instance, the word "CODE" would be encrypted as **3-15-4-5** (C=3, O=15, D=4, E=5). This cipher provides almost no security and is primarily used for puzzles and games.

# Steps
1. Open an online tool like Dcode(https://www.dcode.fr/letter-number-cipher).
2. Select the Number Cipher Tool.
3. Copy and paste the provided cipher text.
4. Click Decrypt or button to continue the process.
