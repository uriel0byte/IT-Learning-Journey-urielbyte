# Description
The one time pad can be cryptographically secure, but not when you know the key. Can you solve this?
We've given you the encrypted flag, key, and a table to help UFJKXQZQUNB with the key of SOLVECRYPTO. Can you use this [table](https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_fickle_tempest/859ffc313a4d8b63149f144745043a7312fc4f993e405eeeb8ee5ae6ca8444a8/table.txt) to solve it?.

# Hints
1.  Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{HELLO}' as the flag.
2.  Please use all caps for the message.

# Steps
1. Open CyberChef, put the Vigenere Decode in because when I first saw this I think of Viegenere, Copy the encrypted flag and the key.
2. Voila!
