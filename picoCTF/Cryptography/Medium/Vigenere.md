# Hints
1.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher

# What is Vigenere?
The Vigenère cipher is an encryption method that uses a simple, repeatable keyword to encrypt a message (the plaintext). It's an improvement over the Caesar cipher because it uses multiple different Caesar ciphers sequentially, which makes frequency analysis much harder.

  - Polyalphabetic: This means that a single letter in the plaintext can be represented by many different characters in the ciphertext, depending on its position and the current letter of the keyword.

  - Mechanism: Encryption is done by taking a letter from the plaintext and a corresponding letter from the keyword, and using a specific formula (often visualized with a Vigenère Square or Vigenère Tableau) to find the ciphertext letter.

# Steps
1. Open an online tool like Dcode and search for Vigenre.
2. Paste the message and don't forget to put the key/password in Decryption method section or keep doing automatically decrypt untill you find the right one.
