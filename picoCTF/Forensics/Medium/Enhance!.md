[Download image file](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/102/drawing.flag.svg)

# Hints
1.  None

# What is DCMI
This is standard metadata automatically generated by vector editors (like Inkscape). While it looks technical, in this specific context, it is mostly "boilerplate" info confirming the file structure. It tells you the file is well-formed, but the flag is likely hidden in the content of the SVG XML itself, not necessarily inside this specific standard tag.

# What is SVG
An image format that uses text-based XML code to describe lines, shapes, and colors, rather than a grid of pixels (like JPEG or PNG).

# Steps
1. Download the provided file.
2. At first, I just automatically use the only tool I can think of "exiftool" and found two links. Which lead to SVG and DCMI Type so I read a bit.
3. Found that SVG can be open in a browser. Then I open up the only web browser to I know "inspect" and just scroll around and found it.
4. Or just use "cat" or "strings" commands directly because SVG is essentially a text file, you don't always need image viewers to analyze it.
