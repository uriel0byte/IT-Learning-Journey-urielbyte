# Description
What was I last working on? I remember writing a note to help me remember... You can download the challenge files here: [challenge.zip]

# Hints
1.  The cat command will let you read a file, but that won't help you here!
2.  Read the chapter on Git from the picoPrimer [here.](https://primer.picoctf.org/#_git_version_control)
3.  When committing a file with git, a message can (and should) be included.

# Steps
1. Download the provided files.
2. Unzip the folder and do "ls -l" to see all the files.
3. Found message.txt and .git directory. Change directory to .git/
4. Used "git log" to examine the history and state especially commit logs. Found it.
