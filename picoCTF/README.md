# picoCTF — Challenge Writeups

CTF challenge writeups from picoCTF. Primary focus is **Forensics** and **General Skills** — the two categories most directly applicable to Blue Team and SOC work. Cryptography and Web Exploitation writeups are included as supplementary material.

Each writeup documents the approach, tools used, and key concepts. Challenges where I got stuck or learned something new are noted explicitly rather than glossed over.

## Forensics

The core of this section. File analysis, steganography, disk forensics, PCAP analysis, metadata extraction, and file carving — all skills that transfer directly to DFIR and SOC work.
