# Description
Can you break into this super secure portal?

# Hints
1. Never trust the client

# Steps
1. First go to the provided website.
2. Inspect the the elements of html.
3. Found a JavaScript function called verify() that checks if the entered password is correct. By reading the function line by line, I can piece together the correct password.
4. I don't know much about web stuff, so I search up what this room's taught me in the process.

# What is Client-Side Verification?

In web development, there are two places code can run:

The Server-Side: The computer owned by the website (Google, Facebook, etc.). The user cannot see this code.

The Client-Side: The user's browser (Chrome, Firefox). The user can see and edit this code.

# The Lesson

Never trust the client. Sensitive checks (like passwords, admin privileges, or flags) must always happen on the Server-Side, where the user cannot see or manipulate the code.

Client-Side (Bad): Browser has the Key → Checks Lock → Tells Server "I opened it!"

Server-Side (Good): Browser sends Password → Server Checks Lock → Server says "Open/Closed"
