# Description
Can you find the robots?

# Hints
1. What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

# Steps
1. First go to the provided website.
2. Inspect the the elements of html. Found nothing.
3. I searched "what is robots in website" and notice the Robots.txt which is a text file located in the root directory that tells search engine bots which pages they should not visit.
4. So I add /robots.txt after the url.
5. It came back with "Disallow: /cc6b1.html"
6. So I used that redirect path (I don't know what it's called) instead.
7. Found the flag.
